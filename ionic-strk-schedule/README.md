## Overview

**STRK Schedule** is a Web3-powered decentralized healthcare platform designed to help individuals manage diabetes more effectively. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform enables secure tracking of blood sugar levels, medication, activity logs, and medical appointments on-chain.

The platform empowers patients with verified medical data NFTs and community-governed reward systems that promote healthy behavior, aiming to improve care, transparency, and engagement in diabetes management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Starknet wallet (Argent X or Braavos)
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/strk-schedule.git
cd strk-schedule
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
VITE_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x07b46771d0012e97bd23a4eadcd3511230a0c97f827f0068cd339e7100d36df4
VITE_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
VITE_PINATA_API_SECRET=your_pinata_api_secret
VITE_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token
```

Replace the Pinata credentials with your own (sign up at [pinata.cloud](https://www.pinata.cloud) if you don't have an account).

Start the development server:

```bash
ionic serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Smart Contract Interaction

The application interacts with Starknet smart contracts to:

- Register and authenticate users
- Store health measurements (blood sugar, HbA1c, weight)
- Track medication adherence
- Manage exercise routines
- Store health records securely

Sensitive data is stored on IPFS with only the hash references stored on-chain for privacy.

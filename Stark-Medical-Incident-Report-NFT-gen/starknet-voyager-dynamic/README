# Voyager API

We are using Voyager API for smart contract verification and also for enabling scalable transaction views for smart contracts, transaction, blocks, events of  medical incidents created by patients and medical service personnel. Voyager’s API provides access to Starknet data on Mainnet and testnet Sepolia. Current endpoints include blocks, transactions, classes, contracts and events.

We are extending the Voyager APIs for validating and viewing the smart contracts, transactions, blocks, events generated for the medical incidents reported by patients and medical service personnel on Starknet.

AIOps using Voyager API: We are extending the implementation of Voyager API to prioritize the ranking of actions (assignment, not assigned) at clinics, government hospitals to be undertaken on medical incidents depending upon the status (pending, in progress and completed).


# Dynamic SDK

We are using Dynamic SDKs to enable onboarding of Web2 users in Stark Schedule project. Integrating with Dynamic enables Web2 -> Web3 transition,  cryptographic operations
support across multiple platforms and Eth based blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability.
